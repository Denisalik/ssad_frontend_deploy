This repository is place for Doctorinna frontend project. It is built using next js framework on react, with redux as state manager and material ui components. Project is written on typescript to allow code completion and catching bugs more easily. Current version is just layout of a SPA.

Later I will add:
 - new pages
 - components for questions
 - enhancement of UI
 - requests for API
 - implementation of questions components
 - result page after all questions are sent

## Getting Started
For project I use Node.js 14, but most of packages works on different versions of node, if you have a problems with sass [https://github.com/sass/node-sass](check supported version) and use different version of node/node-sass package

To learn your version of node run:

```bash
node --version
```

To install dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
